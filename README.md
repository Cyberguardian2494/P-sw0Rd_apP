# Password App üîí

Hello! I'm a beginner in coding, with **no prior experience**, and this project is one of my first steps into the world of **software development** and **cybersecurity**. I built this simple **Python-based password generator** to explore programming concepts and learn how strong passwords are generated.

While there are many websites and tools that create secure passwords, I wanted to **build something from scratch** to understand how it works behind the scenes. This project has helped me practice basic programming, GUI creation, and even explore packaging apps into standalone executables.

## Features
‚úÖ Generates **12-character passwords** with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
‚úÖ Simple **GUI using Tkinter**.  
‚úÖ Standalone executable version available.
